# Welcome to My Programming Learning Journey

## What I'm Currently Learning:
- **C++**: Learning the fundamentals of this powerful programming language.
- **Algorithms**: Understanding different algorithms and how to solve programming challenges.
- **Data Structures**: Exploring how to organize data and optimize performance.
- **Principal Design**: Studying how to design software in a solid and efficient way.

## My Goals:
- Write C++ programs to implement well-known algorithms.
- Explore data structures like lists, trees, and arrays.
- Build small projects using design principles.

## Progress:
- Iâ€™m practicing coding exercises daily and will update this file as I make progress.
